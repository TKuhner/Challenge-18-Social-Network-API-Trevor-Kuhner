# Challenge-18-Social-Network-API-Trevor-Kuhner

## Description
This is a social network API that uses a NoSQL database. It allows users to share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

Data manipulation is done using CRUD methods in Insomnia Core. The user can create, get all, get individual, update, and delete users and thoughts. The user can also add and delete friends and reactions.
